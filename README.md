# Light2D
Several years ago I wanted to have 2D lighting in my Unity games and was dissatisfied with the runtime performance of the other Asset Store solutions at the time. I implemented Nicky Case's popular [Sight & Light](https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/) solution in Unity using the builtin Physics2D colliders and ray casting. It was working for my game at the time and so I thought others might like to use it as well, so I listed it for sale on the Asset Store!

It lived there for years and had a trickling of sales, but I have admittedly let the code go stale as many new Unity versions came and went. There are many ways the solution could be improved and optimized in modern Unity and many assumptions I made back then are not really project agnostic. Rather than continue to sell a partially supported piece of software— I thought it might be better to remove it from the Asset Store. Making it open source here may give other devs something to to experiment with, learn from, and improve upon!

I won't be actively maintaining this repository or reviewing Pull Requests— so please feel free to fork and maintain your own version as you wish and otherwise let this serve as an archival of a cool little plugin that lived on the Asset Store for about 5 years shedding some light on people's 2D games!
